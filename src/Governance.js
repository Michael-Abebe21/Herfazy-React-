            Public Financial Management (PFM): we help governments use their
            domestic revenues more effectively, and provide assurance to donors
            on the use of their funds. This has recently encompassed support to
            Ministries of Finance and Health; there is potential to expand into
            other service delivery line ministries and to local governments
            given an increasing trend to decentralisation. In particular we
            offer: Flexible, innovative technical support to governments to
            strengthen PFM capacity and also robust financial assurance of donor
            portfolios.{" "}

            Public Sector Reform (PSR): We support governments to provide more
            accountable, effective public administration through strengthening
            their leadership and management capabilities and ability to
            implement change. This has primarily focused recently on support to
            revenue administrations, Ministries of Finance and Health but is
            applicable to all government institutions and agencies. There are
            emerging needs from partner governments to support identification,
            procurement and management of national priority investments as well
            as state owned enterprise reforms.

            management, decentralisation. This can be either through direct
            technical assistance or management of technical facilities.{" "}
