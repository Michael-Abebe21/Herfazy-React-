        <p>
          Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing and
          controlling threats to an organization's capital and earnings. These
          threats, or risks, could stem from a wide variety of sources,
          including financial uncertainty, legal liabilities, strategic
          management errors, accidents and natural disasters.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the world of finance, risk management refers to the practice of
          identifying potential risks in advance, analysing them and taking
          precautionary steps to reduce/curb the risk.{" "}
